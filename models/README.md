# Cross-Dataset Model Adaptation Feasibility Study: Models
This directory contains the prediction models trained in the project and intermediate product of the program.  
For more details about how the intermediate product are created and what their meaning is, please check `main.py` or `Project_Interactive_Demo.ipynb` and `pre_processing.py`.
## Notice
This folder and its content can be automatically generated by running `main.py`. If you want to start running the project from zero, you can use `clean_project_dir.py` to restore the project directory to its initial structure.
## Files and Directories
### model_2015.h5
The binary classification model trained on the 2015 dataset. This dataset is used to generate the native 2015 evaluation and adopted 2020 evaluations with three different data-making-up methods.
### model_2020.h5
The binary classification model trained on the 2020 dataset. This dataset is used to generate the native 2020 evaluation as a comparison.
### *mlModelPredictionMakeUp - directory*
Containing the intermediate trained models used to support the `ML Model Prediction` data-making-up method.  
File Names: model_predict_***.h5 (\*\*\* indicates the feature to predict)
