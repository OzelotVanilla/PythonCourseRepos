# Cross-Dataset Model Adaptation Feasibility Study: Datasets
This directory contains the datasets that the project uses and intermediate product of the program.  
For more details about how the intermediate product are created and what their meaning is, please check `main.py` or `Project_Interactive_Demo.ipynb`.
## Notice
This folder and its content can be automatically generated by running `main.py`. If you want to start running the project from zero, you can use `clean_project_dir.py` to restore the project directory to its initial structure.
